# VBA of Wall Street

This project demonstrates my knowledge of VBA, and how I automated the analysis of ticker stock price changes and trends.
It utilizes for loops, if..then statements, conditional formatting, and includes detailed documentation of the program.

## Getting Started

You can download the resource files provided in the "Resources" directory, import the "main.bas" file into the visual basic module and run the program.
